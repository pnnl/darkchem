DarkChem
========

Overview
--------
DarkChem employs a variational autoencoder (VAE) to learn a continuous numerical, or latent, representation of molecular structure, to simultaneously characterize and expand reference libraries for small molecule identification.  DarkChem includes a chemical property decoder, trained as a multitask network, in order to shape the latent representation such that it assembles according to desired chemical properties.  The approach is unique in its application to metabolomics and small molecule identification and in its focus on properties that can be obtained from experimental instruments (mass, CCS). Once trained, the network can be used to predict chemical properties directly from structure, as well as generate candidate structures with chemical properties similar to some arbitrary input.

Installation
------------
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pnnl/darkchem.git
cd darkchem
```

Use [``conda``](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) or [``mamba``](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) to create a new virtual environment with required dependencies using the provided environment file. Mamba is preferred due to its performance advantages over conda.
```bash
conda create --file environment.yml
# or
mamba create --file environment.yml
```

Alternatively, supply dependencies to conda/mamba directly:
```bash
conda create -n darkchem -c conda-forge python=3.8 keras=2.13 tensorflow=2.13 rdkit openbabel numpy scipy scikit-learn pandas
# or
mamba create -n darkchem -c conda-forge python=3.8 keras=2.13 tensorflow=2.13 rdkit openbabel numpy scipy scikit-learn pandas
```

Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
conda activate darkchem
# or
mamba activate darkchem
```

Ensure you are in the repository folder and install using [``pip``](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):
```bash
pip install -e .
```

Getting Started
---------------
The easiest way to get started with DarkChem is to use the supplied CLI entry points. Data can be preprocessed with ``darkchem prep``, resulting files can be used to train with ``darkchem train``, and prediction with new data using a trained network can be performed with ``darkchem predict``. The ``--help`` or ``-h`` flag can be used with each of these commands for additional information.

More advanced functionality requires the use of DarkChem as an API. For example, in order to load pre-trained weights and predict the latent represenation of a set of structures:

```python
import numpy as np
import darkchem

# load model
model = darkchem.utils.load_model('/path/to/model_folder/')  # arguments.txt must be present in this folder, as well as respective network weights

# load data
x = np.load('/path/to/smiles.npy')

# generate latent space
x_latent = model.encoder.predict(x)

# generate property predictions
y_pred = model.predictor.predict(x_latent)

# predict SMILES outputs
x_pred = model.decoder.predict(x_latent)
```
